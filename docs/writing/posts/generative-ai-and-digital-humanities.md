# Why Qualitative Research Experts Are the Secret Weapon for Generative AI Evaluation

To my colleagues in digital humanities, anthropology, and experts in qualitative research: you're sitting on a goldmine and don't even know it.

While everyone's trying to learn "prompt engineering," you are the true experts because you have been doing this for your entire career. 

You know how to write precise, nuanced questions that extract meaningful responses. 

You understand context, subtext, and how framing shapes answers. You're experts in context analysis, at iterative inquiry and grounded theory .

You evaluate sources critically, find biases and inconsistencies, and know that the most interesting insights often lie in what's not being said. 

You understand that interpretation requires both rigor and creativity. 
 
These aren't just transferable skills, they're the skills that matter most when designing, evaluating and aligning LLMs or AI agents.

The AI world is busy teaching engineers to think like qualitative researchers. 

Meanwhile, you already think like AI researchers. You just need to learn the syntax.
When this clicks for our field, we won't just be catching up, we'll be leading the conversation on responsible AI evaluation and human-centered AI systems design.

The skills to evaluate AI agents are not that different from evaluating humans. 

As I've specialized more in AI agent evaluation, I can't stop thinking about how my colleagues and I, as engineers, are 'discovering' methodologies that you have known for ages.

You are so well equipped to help design evaluation or fine-tuning datasets and you don't even know it.

The future of AI isn't just engineering. It is more human than ever. And that's your territory.
