# Hi

I'm a AI Engineer at [Faktion](https://faktion.com/), specialized in Generative AI evaluation methodologies. 

My work involves designing AI Soltuions, architecting LLM agents and implementing structured evaluation processes for AI Assistants.

*Let's discuss your AI challenges and how evaluation-driven development can accelerate your success*

## Featured Work & Insights

I write extensively about LLM evaluation, enterprise AI adoption challenges, and practical methodologies for building reliable AI systems. Here are some key insights from my work:

### Core Expertise
- **LLM Evaluation Pipelines**: Developing systematic approaches to measure and improve generative AI performance
- **Evaluation-Driven Development**: Creating methodologies that bridge the gap between automated metrics and user satisfaction
- **Enterprise AI Adoption**: Understanding why evaluation, not models, is often the limiting factor in AI deployment

## Open Source Contributions

I'm also one of the creators of [YAKE](https://github.com/LIAAD/yake), a popular keyword extraction library with over 1.7k stars. YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method that relies on text statistical features to select the most important keywords from single documents.
